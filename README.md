# SeanForFunBlog
<p>This is the source code of project SeanforfunBlog. This is a java web based technology blog.</p>
<p>I always write some conclusion files and append them into my different repositories. However, it is difficult when I was going to read them. By the way, I want to design this blog completely by myself and test the knowledge I've learnt from Sept, 2017.</p>
<p>I named this blog as Seanforfun which is my nickname of Github and I hope this blog will publish soon :)</p>

## Technical selections:
<p>Front: BootStrap, JQuery, HTML5</p>
<p>Backend: SpringBoot, Spring, SpringMVC and MyBatis.</p>
<p>DataBase: MySQL</p>
